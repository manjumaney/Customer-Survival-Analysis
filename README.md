# Customer-Survival-Analysis
# Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecommunications Industry

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications sector through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning model comparisons. The aim is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the likelihood of customer attrition. By identifying at-risk customers, telecom companies can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty.

## Introduction

Customer churn is a critical issue in industries that rely on long-term customer relationships, such as telecommunications. Understanding the factors that lead to customer attrition and predicting which customers are likely to leave can help businesses improve retention strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and increase profitability.

### Aim

The primary aim of this project is to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer churn data to identify key factors and patterns associated with customer attrition. This analysis will involve examining and visualizing data distributions, relationships between features, and patterns in customer behavior to uncover insights that could inform churn prediction models.

## Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a robust customer survival analysis model and churn prediction system that can accurately forecast customer attrition. The objective is to:

- Identify and understand the factors contributing to customer churn.
- Assess the risk levels of individual customers.
- Estimate customers' expected lifetime value.

This will involve analyzing historical customer data, identifying patterns indicative of potential churn, and implementing predictive models to anticipate which customers are at the highest risk of leaving.

## Solution

The solution involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Gather customer data, including usage patterns, demographics, and interaction history. 
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to identify trends, patterns, and correlations related to customer attrition. Visualize data to uncover key insights into factors driving churn.
3. **Feature Selection:** Use insights from EDA to select important features that will guide the development of predictive models.
4. **Model Development:** Implement and compare various machine learning models to predict customer churn. Refine models based on performance metrics.
5. **Strategy Development:** Based on the model's findings, develop strategies to address common churn triggers and improve retention efforts.

## Repository Structure

- **Data:** Telco-Customer-Churn.csv is the dataset used for analysis and modeling. 
- **Notebooks:** AIDI_1002_Final_Project_Template.ipynb contain the EDA, model development, and evaluation. Python scripts are used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Contains results, visualizations, and model performance metrics. Documentation and additional resources.
